# Simpsons Trivia Game

DESCRIPTION

This is a very simple trivia game to see how many characters you can name from
the popular animated tv series The Simpsons.

HOW TO PLAY

1. Once the page has loaded, you're ready to begin.
2. Starting with the top left image and working your way across and down, see if you
   can name each character by their picture. There are 30 images total.
3. If you know the character's name, you click the blue "Correct Guess" button at the top of
   the page and an alert will notify you that you've guessed correctly. Upon clicking 
   "Okay" for this alert, your "correct" score will go up by one.
4. If you do not know the character's name, you click the red "Incorrect Guess" button and
   an alert will confirm that the guess was incorrect. After you click "Okay" for this alert,
   your "incorrect" score will go up by one.
