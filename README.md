# Simpsons Trivia Game

DESCRIPTION

This is a very simple trivia game to see how many characters you can name from
the popular animated tv series The Simpsons.

HOW TO PLAY

1. Once the page has loaded, you're ready to begin.
2. Starting with the top left image and working your way across and down,    see if you
   can name each character by their picture. There are 30 images total.
3. If you know the character's name, you click the blue "Correct Guess" button at the top left of
   the page and an alert will notify you that you've guessed correctly. Upon clicking 
   "Okay" for this alert, your "correct" score will go up by one.
4. If you do not know the character's name, you click the red "Incorrect Guess" button and
   an alert will confirm that the guess was incorrect. After you click "Okay" for this alert,
   your "incorrect" score will go up by one.
5. After you've clicked a correct or incorrect point for the character you're on, click on
   the character's image and their name will appear below their image. This will help you
   keep track of the characters you've already done. You also can reveal their name before
   you increment your correct/incorrect score to see if you were right before moving on.
6. At the end of the game your correct and incorrect guesses should add up to 30. If not,
   go back and see who you missed.
7. Good luck and have fun!
